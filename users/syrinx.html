   <h5><p>I am the sysadmin, co-developer and a writer for this site. When the site goes down, blame me. When it works well, blame somebody else. I am passionate about many a topic, including FOSS, cybersecurity, and anticensorship (Is that a word? Should it be hyphenated? IDK.) I am a linux user with a serious distro hopping problem (Srsly, halp!) Currently, I am running <del>a heavily modified Xubuntu 19.04 install</del> <del>Kubuntu 19.04</del> <del>Ubuntu 19.04</del> Solus Gnome. I am the kind of person who doesn't pay more than a few dollars for a computer and then installs $100 worth of hardware in it, a great example of this is the server that I host this site on. Bought it for $5, upgraded the RAM, installed several hard drives and spent hours fine tuning everything. I then lost all of the case screws and had the main hard drive fail.</p></h5>
