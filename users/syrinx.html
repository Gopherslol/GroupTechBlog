   <h5>I am the sysadmin, co-developer and a writer for this site. When the site goes down, blame me. When it works well, blame somebody else. I am passionate about many a topic, including FOSS, cybersecurity, and anticensorship (Is that a word? Should it be hyphenated? IDK.) I am a linux user with a serious distro hopping problem (Srsly, halp!) Currently, I am running a heavily modified Xubuntu 19.04 install.
